<h3>Domain Name System</h3>

<p>
The Domain Name System was originally developed in 1983 as a scalable 
way to map hostnames to IP addresses. It scales to the vast, and quickly
 changing, range of hostnames by using a hierarchal tree structure.   
Each piece of the hostname, seperated with periods, typically represents
 another ordered level of the tree beginning at the root with the 
rightmost piece. 
The root of the tree is simply referred to as the root.   Below the root
 are generic top level domains (edu., com., net., etc) and country code 
top level domains (uk.,  cn.,  etc).   Each TLD further subdivides to 
produce domains such as colostate.edu. and deterlab.net.   These domains
 can then further subdivide to produce domains such as cs.colostate.edu.
  The protocol has evolved over the years, but the principles behind it 
remain largely the same. The process is largely automated for end-users,
 but virtually every Internet application requires some DNS lookup. 


<span class="anchor" id="dnsoverview"></span> 
</p><h4>DNS Overview</h4>

<p>
For this exercise, it's important to understand the basic DNS lookup 
process.  An end-user starts by querying a DNS cache on their local 
network.   For example, the end-user's web browser might  generate a 
request for a specified address (e.g. "www.google.com.") and forwards it
 to the local DNS cache. The DNS cache is a semi-public server, 
typically maintained by the end-user's ISP or organization.  If the 
local cache doesn't know the answer,  it recursively traverses the DNS 
tree until it resolves the original request of the end-user.   The local
 cache must be configured with the addresses for the DNS root servers.  
  The cache can then ask a root server for "www.google.com.".   The root
 does not know the answer,  but can refer the local cache to the "com." 
servers.    The cache can then ask the a ".com" server for 
"www.google.com.".   The ".com" server does not know the answer either, 
 but it can refer the cache to the servers for "google.com."   Finally, 
 the local cache queries a server for "google.com." and this server 
returns the desired answer.   The server is called a cache because, for 
efficiency reasons, it will store answers for a pre-determined amount of
 time so that it can answer without consulting the tree if a query for 
the same information comes in.

<span class="anchor" id="dnsvulns"></span> 
<h4>DNS Vulnerabilities</h4>

<p>
Like most protocols designed for the early internet, DNS wasn't designed
 with any security concerns in mind. Classical DNS is done entirely via 
plaintext messages, meaning that at third party can easily read the 
conversation. It also does very little by way of message verification, 
meaning that the end-user has no way of knowing if the message was 
altered en-route or if DNS servers supplying the information are acting 
maliciously. This leaves the service open to several well-known vectors 
of attack which will be summarized in the following sections.
 
</p><p>
It should be noted that most classic DNS caches have been patched to 
include some safeguards. Most commonly, they randomize the sending port 
when making their queries to outside servers and also randomize a field 
in the DNS protocol called the "Query ID" which was originally meant to 
uniquely identify queries using the same port. They then verify that 
those fields in the received response match the originals. This makes it
 harder for a remote attacker to forge a response as the attacker must 
guess the port and the Query ID.   However,  an attacker that can 
observe the original query learns both the port and Query ID and can 
trivially forge a reply.

<span class="anchor" id="mitm"></span> 
<h4>Man in the Middle</h4>
<p>
The man-in-the-middle attack vector is fairly common to network 
services, and effective on virtually all communications that don't make 
use of cryptographic encryption or authentication. In essence, the 
attacker must position themself between the client and the server on a 
network. From there, they can intercept messages going in either 
direction and alter or deny them at will, violating either the integrity
 or the availability of the service. In the context of DNS, it is most 
common for the attacker to position themself somewhere between the 
end-user and the relevant DNS server, then alter the DNS response to 
supply a different IP address for the requested internet address, 
effectively rerouting the user anywhere they want. There is very little 
that can be done to mitigate this attack using regular DNS protocol 
besides protecting the network path taken by the DNS messages, and it 
will also be the form of attack highlighted by this exercise.
</p><ul>

</li></ul> 

<span class="anchor" id="birthday"></span> 
<h4>Birthday Attack</h4>
<p>
Unlike man-in-the-middle, the Birthday attack is specific to DNS and has
 the goal of "cache poisoning." Most DNS information remains in the DNS 
cache for somewhere between an hour and a day after it is initially 
requested. While this is important for efficiency (a cache lookup is 
much less expensive in terms of time and resources than a recursive 
query to the outside Internet), it means that if an attacker can supply 
the cache with malicious but seemingly valid data for a common address, 
they can redirect a potentially large number of users in the subsequent 
time-frame. It's worth noting that there are several other forms of 
cache poisoning that involve inserting unrequested data into other 
fields of the DNS response, but they use a more systematic approach that
 is completely ineffective against any up-to-date caching server. 

</p><p>
The Birthday attack uses a comparatively simple means to this end. An 
attacker will send a query to the caching server quickly followed by a 
response to that same query. If the response appears valid to the 
caching sever, it will accept it and add the "poison" data into cache. 
Virtually all caching servers have a policy of ignoring any subsequent 
responses received for the same query. However, to make the faked 
response seem valid, the attacker may have to do several things 
including: spoofing the ip of the DNS server queried by the cache, 
correctly guessing the sending port used by the cache, and correctly 
guessing the query id used by the cache. The later two require correctly
 guessing 16-bit numbers(both of which are ideally random) which gives 
the attack a low, but non-negligible, chance of success. 

<span class="anchor" id="kaminsky"></span> 
</p><h4>Kaminsky Attack</h4>
<p>
The Kaminsky attack is a well-known derivative of the birthday attack 
that uses various means to increase success probability, the specifics 
of which require a fairly detailed understanding of certain edge-cases 
in the DNS protocol.

</li></ul> 

<span class="anchor" id="publickey"></span> 
<h4>Public Key Cryptography</h4>
<p>
Public key cryptography is built on the concept of a "one-way", also 
called "asynchronous,"  function. Mathematically, 
it's trivial to get from point A to point B, but extremely difficult if 
not impossible to get from point B back to point A.
The asynchronous function is essential because it allows for 
cryptography without the secure exchange of a shared key ahead of time. 
 

</p><p>
In the public key system, a user generates what's referred to as an "asynchronous key pair." This pair includes a
private key that is very hard to derive without previously knowing it, and a public key which is freely distributed
to other users. The private key, by virtue of the chosen cryptographic method, can be used to sign any message. The owner
of the private key would then distribute the message and the generated signature. Any user with the public key, message, 
and signature can then verify that the signature matches the message and was generated by the private key.

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography" target="new">Public Key Cryptography</a> wikipedia (optional reading)
</li></ul> 

<span class="anchor" id="verification"></span> 
<h4>Cryptographic Authentication</h4>
<p>
Cryptographic Authentication refers to the process of generating a 
digital signature(similar to a hash) for a given message. An end-user 
can use the message, signature, and public key of the sender to verify 
that the message hasn't been changed and was indeed signed by the sender
 (as described in the previous section). Provided that the public-key is
 trusted, either because it was also signed, by the previous DNS server 
in the chain, or was for a root server, the end-user has cryptographic 
proof of the sender and data-integrity.

</li></ul> 

<span class="anchor" id="dnssec"></span> 
<h4>Domain Name System Security Extensions(DNSSEC)</h4>
<p>
DNSSEC is an enhancement to the DNS protocol that integrates 
cryptographic authentication into DNS messages. DNSSEC assures data 
integrity, mitigating man in the middle and cache-poisoning attacks 
using a "chain of trust." In essence, you trust the response you get 
from each server if it has been vouched for by the server before it in 
the lookup.  It's still necessary to trust the supplied public key for 
the root DNS servers, but there are various political and administrative
 procedures in place to ensure their trustability. 

</p><p>
For this exercise, you'll be required to implement DNSSEC for a BIND9 
DNS caching server. While the installation itself is fairly 
straightforward, you should also understand the basic cryptography in 
use, explained in the previous section, to avoid pitfalls.

</li></ul> 

<span class="anchor" id="arp"></span> 
<h4>Address Resolution Protocol(ARP)</h4>
<p>
ARP is another protocol developed for basic networking.  ARP is 
important to this exercise because you'll be using a flaw in the 
protocol to position yourself for the man-in-the-middle attack. 

ARP is used to to resolve a network layer address (e.g., IP address) to a
 link layer address (e.g., MAC address). When a host wishes to send an 
IP packet to a remote host, it first creates the IP packet. However, the
 hardware in the network interface must encapsulate the packet in a link
 layer frame (commonly Ethernet) before sending the data out on the 
wire. In order to assign the frame to the correct destination address, 
the local host must use ARP to determine which hardware address 
corresponds to the next hop for the IP packet. This involves sending 
special ARP messages called <em>ARP Requests</em> on the local Ethernet and receiving replies from hosts that have the answer. 
 
</p><p> 
For example, the host <tt>10.10.10.20</tt> needs to send data to the 
Internet. In order to reach the  Internet, it must send the data through
 its default gateway, which is configured with IP address <tt>10.10.10.10</tt>. The sending host <tt>10.10.10.20</tt> needs to know what  Ethernet address <tt>10.10.10.10</tt> has in order to put the correct MAC address in the  frame header. In order to discover this, <tt>10.10.10.20</tt> needs to broadcast an ARP request to all Ethernet nodes: 
 
</p><p> 
 
</p><pre>arp who-has 10.10.10.10 tell 10.10.10.20
 
 
</pre> 
<p> 
... Hopefully, 10.10.10.20 will receive a reply like: 
 
</p><p> 
 
</p><pre>arp reply 10.10.10.10 is-at 2e:2f:30:31:32:33
 
</pre> 
<p> 
... from some host that knows the answer. Host 10.10.10.20 will update 
its ARP tables associating the IP 10.10.10.10 with the MAC address 
2e:2f:30:31:32:33 and won't ask again for some time.

<span class="anchor" id="spoof"></span>
<h4>ARP Spoofing</h4>
<p> 
ARP Spoofing is a technique for redirecting traffic that can allow an 
arbitrary interface on an otherwise unsecured switched network to 
receive traffic that would not normally be sent to it. 
 
</p><p> 
 
</p><p> 
ARP Spoofing relies on the decentralized, unauthenticated, and 
completely trusting nature of ARP to succeed. In ARP Spoofing, the 
attacker (or spoofer) tells specific hosts or entire networks that <em>its MAC address</em>
 should be associated with the victim's IP address, rather than the 
correct MAC to IP mapping. This is commonly used to tell network hosts 
that an <em>attacker</em> is the default gateway instead of the real default gateway.  The spoofer keeps the victim's <em>real</em> MAC address in its ARP table, and prepares to receive data from network hosts. 
 
</p><p> 
When an attacker pretends to be the default gateway for a network, all 
hosts that received the bogus ARP messages now believe that the <em>spoofer's</em>
 MAC should be inserted into any Ethernet frame destined for the 
Internet or another IP subnet instead of the real default gateway's MAC 
address. <strong>This is especially meaningful</strong> because Ethernet switches <em>build their own ARP tables</em> in order to efficiently direct traffic and avoid broadcasting like a hub. This means that <em>Ethernet switches will be fooled in addition to the remote hosts</em>. As a result, switches will direct default gateway-bound traffic to the <em>spoofer</em>, not the <strong>real</strong> default gateway. Furthermore, a spoofing host that wishes to remain undetected can <em>rewrite and forward the Ethernet frames to the real default gateway</em>.
 This method silently maintains the victim's connections while routing 
them conveniently under the nose of the sniffer. In this way, ARP 
Spoofing acts as a kind of network reconfiguration at the data link 
layer and highlights Ethernet's dependence on ARP. 
 
</p><p> 
At this point, the spoofing host has almost total control of the network
 traffic and can see and sniff arbitrary hosts' data with the use of a 
promiscuous interface and packet sniffing software. ARP Spoofing does 
slow down network traffic because of the additional hops and 
procesessing involved, but the clever attacker will target only the 
hosts she wants to affect, rather than the whole network. ARP Spoofing 
also requires multiple spoofing actions to maintain the tables in their 
bogus state, but this is not a difficult burden to bear. Furthermore, 
the careful spoofer can restore the ARP tables of the network before 
quitting, resulting in minimal network disruption due to the spoofing. 
 
</p><p> 
While there are strategies against ARP Spoofing, notably ARP monitoring, fixed ARP tables and <a class="http" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLAN">VLAN</a>s,
 these are expensive in terms of maintenance, network design, and may 
require specialized hardware. Because of this, most networks in use 
today are at least partially vulnerable to ARP Spoofing attacks. 
 
</p><p> 
Being the "man in the middle" gives you the opportunity to perform the DNS manipulation discussed earlier.

<span class="anchor" id="ettercap"></span> 
<h4>Ettercap</h4>
<p> 
<a class="http" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettercap_%28computing%29">Ettercap</a> is a powerful tool for network analysis and security cracking. Ettercap has two main strengths: 
 
</p><p> 
Finally we need a few last tools for the exercise.   Ettercap is capable of performing <a class="http" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle</a>
 attacks on many protocols, including ARP and DNS. Ettercap is capable 
of "filtering" packets, where it intercepts, changes, and resends 
packets on the fly. This could be as simple as changing all occurances 
of the word "buy" to "sell" in all web traffic, or as complex as 
exchanging the encryption keys in a secure transmission. 
 
</p><p> 
Secondly, Ettercap is capable of fully automating ARP spoofing (also 
known as ARP poisoning) which is a technique whereby a computer on a 
switched network is capable of forcing other hosts to send their data to
 the attacker rather than the actual network gateway or destination. 
This allows an attacker to force arbitrary users to send their data to 
him first -- after which he can choose to send the traffic on, change 
it, or throw it away -- all without any privileged position on the 
network other than the complete control of one workstation. 
 
</p><p> 
By the inclusion of ARP spoofing, expressive filters, and 
man-in-the-middle attacks, Ettercap is a one-stop-shop for many network 
attacks. Where such attacks used to require specialized software 
development (often customized for a particular network or attack), 
Ettercap is a user-friendly tool that makes network attacks incredibly 
simple.

<span class="anchor" id="tcp"></span>
<h4>TCPDUMP</h4>
<p>
To examine the MAC addresses on packets in this exercise and possibly 
the contents of the packets themselves, we recommend you use a 
command-line tool called TCPDUMP. It's a very common and useful tool for
 looking at network traffic so you'll want to get acquainted with the 
man-page if you aren't already.

<h4>DNS lookup utility(dig)</h4>
<p>
dig is a standard command line tool for making DNS queries (typically 
for network debugging purposes). In this exercise you'll be using it 
both to simulate DNS queries from an internet browser and to debug your 
configuration if necessary. You should be familiar with its standard 
Unix syntax.

<span class="anchor" id="intro"></span> 
<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>
For the first portion of the exercise, you'll take the position of an 
attacker(or possibly a network administrator doing penetration testing 
on their network). You'll be using a malicious box on the same switched 
LAN as the end-user, and your goal will be to supply the end-user with a
 false IP when they query for www.google.com. You'll also have access to
 box representing the end-user in order to simulate the query and 
observe the response, but you shouldn't access any other boxes before 
the second portion of the exercise.

</p><p>
For the second portion of the exercise, you'll take the position of a 
network administrator working to addresses DNS vulnerabilities in their 
network. You'll have access to the caching server and authoritative 
nameserver and will be charged with implementing DNSSEC for 
www.google.com. You'll also need to verify that it is no longer 
susceptible to a man-in-the-middle data manipulation attack.

<span class="anchor" id="ni"></span> 
<h3>Network Information</h3>

<p>
The network in this exercise is designed to simulate an end-user and a 
recursive DNS system as simply as possible. To that end, there is a 
single authoritative DNS server which handles all the levels in the 
setup (root, com., google.com.). The DNS caching server has a direct 
line to the authoritative DNS server and shares a switch with the 
end-user and attacker on it's other interface. Ordinarily, when the 
end-user makes a query, it will be sent to the caching server which then
 traverses the small DNS tree in the setup by making several queries to 
the authoritative server. Once it gets the required response, it 
forwards it on to the end-user. The caching server also stores the 
answer for a small (10 seconds) but easily observable amount of time. For
 more detailed information, it's easiest to consult the actual 
simulation once you've set it up.

<h4>Part 1: Understanding DNS </h4>

<p> Login to the <tt>client</tt> machine and use the dig command to lookup the IPv4 address of <tt>www.google.com</tt> using the command "<tt>dig www.google.com A</tt>". 

</p><ol>
<li>  The dig command sent a DNS query to some DNS server and received a

</li><li>   How long will the www.google.com IPv4 address be cached?
</li><li>   The response listed the nameserver that is authoritative

Be sure to issue the dig command from the client machine.  The IPv4 
addresses associated with this exercise begin with 10.   If you are 
seeing other IPv4 address, then you may be querying the  real DNS tree 
rather than the one in the exercise. While this is harmless and 
interesting in and of itself,  the later steps assume you are using the 
DNS tree created in this exercise.

</p><h4>Part 3: Using Ettercap</h4>
<p>
</p><div class="warning">

<strong>Warning!</strong> <strong>Do not ARP Poison any control interface (192.168.x.x)! Check which interface on attacker node has 10.x.x.x address and use that interface with -i option with ettercap, to make sure your poisoning stays on experimental network.</strong> 
</p></div> 

<p>
Login to the <tt>attacker</tt> machine.   Using ettercap,  your 
objective is to get the DNS query for www.google.com to pass through the
 attacker.   Once you've accomplished this and confirmed that the 
desired traffic is now passing through the attacker, record the 
following:
 
</p><ol>
<li>The command you used</li>
<li>What each option in the command means</li>
<li>State the source MAC and IP addresses as well as destination MAC and
 IP addresses for a packet going from the cache to the authoritative server</li>
<li>Does the packet travel through the attacker box?</li>
<li>If your answers to parts 2.3 and 3.4 differ, explain why</li>
</ol>


<p> 

</p><p>
Now that you can ARP spoof on the network, your goal is to actually 
filter DNS messages returning to the end-user and replace the IP for 
"www.google.com." with an IP of your choosing (say the attacker: 
10.1.2.4). It's possible to do this with a custom made ettercap filter, 
but due to some of the intricacies of the DNS protocol, it can get quite
 complicated. Since the DNS protocol is not the focus of this exercise, 
we recommend you use a plug-in built into ettercap called "dns_spoof". 
You can find the syntax for using a plug-in via the ettercap man page, 
and the config file for dns_spoof (located at 
/etc/ettercap/etter.dns) should be self-explanatory. 
A good example of using ettercap for DNS spoofing is 
<A HREF="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/05/ettercap-tutorial/">at this page</A>. (These authors use the graphical interface, although the text mode interface is similar.)</p>

</p><h4>Part 4: Implementing DNSSEC</h4>
<p>
  The final task to prevent this type of attack by cryptographically signing the DNS data.   Login to <tt>auth</tt> and follow instructions <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-setup-dnssec-on-an-authoritative-bind-dns-server-2">here</a> to set up DNSSEC. <b>IMPORTANT: Your zone file is already present at /etc/bind/zones/db.google.com. This is the file you should sign.</b>

  Then restart <tt>bind</tt> and try on the <tt>auth</tt> machine: <tt>dig +dnssec  www.google.com A</tt>. You should get a signed response.

<P>On the <tt>cache</tt> machine, add the public zone signing key (ZSK) to the list of trust-anchors for the cache. An example how to do this is <A HREF="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-setup-dnssec-on-an-authoritative-bind-dns-server-2">here</A> (skip the part about DS record and later sections). You can use <tt>dig google.com dnskey</tt> on <tt>auth</tt> to learn what keys to add to the list. You must also add lines to <tt>/etc/bind/named.conf.options</tt>  that tell it to use dnssec (same ones as in the previous step). Then restart <tt>bind</tt> on <tt>cache</tt> and run <tt>dig +dnssec  www.google.com A</tt>. You should get a signed response.

<P>Finally, return to the <tt>client</tt> machine and use the command "<tt>dig +dnssec  www.google.com A</tt>" to lookup the IPv4 address for <tt>www.google.com</tt>.

<P>For part 4,  turn in:
<ol>
<li>The signed response obtained on the <tt>client</tt> machine
<li>Detailed description of all the steps you took to implement DNSSEC. Make sure to list all commands you typed and all configuration changes you made.
</ol>
<div class="infobox"> 
<p> 
<img src="idea.png">A properly DNSSEC verified dig will include an "ad" bit which shows up in the tag field of dig output. 
</p></div> 
 
<p> 

You may want to run the attack again now that your network is DNSSEC 
enabled. You'll notice that while ettercap is no longer able to 
successfully implant an IP, it can still cause denial of service because
 all Ethernet traffic is still travelling through it.

<h3>What can go wrong</h3>
<p>Specific problems:
 
</p><ul> 
<li>Make sure you use <tt>sudo</tt>. Most of the commands above require root privileges.
<li>If you type a command and the system cannot find it run <tt>locate</tt> commandname to find where it is.
<li>If <tt>ettercap</tt> doesn't seem to be working, make sure you are poisoning 
the correct interface. You should be poisoning the 10.x.x.x interface.</li> 
<li>Signing of the zone file must be run in <tt>/etc/bind/zones</tt> directory.
<li>Bind is really picky about the syntax of its configuration files. To detect where a problem may be if bind refuses to start use <tt>named-checkconf</tt> tool.
  <li>If ad bit is not set check that: (1) you are running the command on <tt>client<//t> node and that you have added trust anchors on <tt>cache</tt>. These <a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/unix-linux-test-and-validate-dnssec-using-dig-command-line/">troubleshooting tricks</a> may be useful.
